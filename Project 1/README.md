Hi, there are some things I need to say for you to run the program
- If the program asks for time, give it Unix Epoch time. Look here: https://www.unixtimestamp.com/
- If the program asks for a bool, enter a 0 for false, a 1 for true.
- It shouldn't happen, but if you press enter on something and it just goes to the next line, press enter again.
- If it errors when removing an object, delete the .dat file and try something else

- I have tested the program rigorously in the CSE machines, most of it runs fine I could not figure out deleting things properly so it will throw a segfalt if you print after deleting I tried my hardest to figure out how to fix this but I ran out of time and had to turn in. If you have any issues other than that, please contact me.
